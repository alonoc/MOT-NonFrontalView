# MOT Selection Criteria

This is a check list of features that every MOT approach must fulfill in order to
be selected for the MOT from non frontal view in crowded scenes investigation.

* **C1 - The approach must be part of the state-of-the-art in (MOT)**
* **C2 - Source code must be available, compile, and run**
* **C3 - Source code does not require any private license**
* **C4 - The approach could run in a standard PC, and no extra hardware must be required*
* **C6 - The approach could be trained in less than 2 days in a standard PC*

# Priority Criteria

This is a list of priority criteria that will be used to test the MOT approach due to
we have a limit amount of time and effort:

* ** Approaches with best performance in state-of-the art*
* ** Approaches tested in persons and crowded sceces*
* ** Expert criteria based on non-frontal view, human-body perspective, etc*
